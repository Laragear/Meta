A Laravel Package helper for Laravel Packages.

```php
public function boot()
{
    $this->publishMigrations(__DIR__.'/../migrations');
    
    $this->withSchedule(fn($schedule) => $schedule->command('inspire')->hourly());
}
```

Your support allows me to keep this package free, up-to-date and maintainable. Alternatively, you can **[spread the word!](http://twitter.com/share?text=I%20am%20using%20this%20cool%20PHP%20package&url=https://github.com%2FLaragear%2FMeta&hashtags=PHP,Laravel)**

## Requirements

* Laravel 10 or later.

## Installation

Require this package into your project using Composer, along with the development-only testers:

```shell
composer require laragear/meta
composer require --dev laragear/meta-testing
```

## Discoverer

The `Discover` class is a builder that allows discovering classes under a given path. It contains various fluent methods to filter the classes to discover, like methods, properties, interfaces and traits, among others. 

It has been moved into [its own repository](https://github.com/Laragear/Discover). You may install it alongside this package, but is not required to.

```shell
composer require laragear/discover
```

## Middleware declaration

When using `withMiddleware()` you will receive a `MiddlewareDeclaration` object with convenient methods to register the middleware globally or inside a group, set it as first/last in the global priority stack, and register an alias for it.

```php
public function boot()
{
    $declaration = $this->withMiddleware(OnlyAdults::class);
    
    // Make it a shared instance.
    $declaration->shared();
    
    // Set an alias
    $declaration->as('adults');
    
    // Puts it inside a middleware group.
    $declaration->inGroup('web');
    
    // Sets the middleware in the global stack.
    $declaration->globally();
    
    // Makes the middleware run first or last in the priority stack.
    $declaration->first();
    $declaration->last();
}
```

## Builder extender

The `ExtendsBuilder` trait allows a [Global Scope](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#global-scopes) to extend the instance of the Eloquent Builder with new methods. Simply start your builder methods `extend`, no matter wich  visibility scope or if the method is static or not. 

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Scope;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Laragear\Meta\Database\Eloquent\ExtendsBuilder;

class Cars implements Scope
{
    use ExtendsBuilder;
    
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
    {
        // ...
    }
    
    private function extendWhereAvailable($builder)
    {
        return $builder->where('available_at', '>', now());
    }
    
    protected static function extendWhereColor($builder, string $color)
    {
        return $builder->where('base_color', $color);
    }
}
```
> [!TIP]
> 
> If you need the model being queried, you can always use `getModel()` over the Eloquent Builder instance. 

## Command Helpers

This meta package includes the `WithEnvironmentFile` helper trait to modify the environment file keys and values.

```php
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Laragear\Meta\Console\Commands\WithEnvironmentFile;


class AddServiceKey extends Command
{
    use WithEnvironmentFile;
    
    public function handle()
    {
        // ...
        
        $this->putEnvKey('AWESOME_SERVICE', $this->argument('service_key'))
    }
}
```

## Upgrading

### Testing

Prior version of Laragear Meta contained testing helpers for packages. These have been migrated to [Laragear MetaTesting](https://github.com/Laragear/MetaTesting) separately. You can use these helpers in your project with Composer to install as development dependency:

```bash
composer require --dev laragear/meta-testing
```

### `PublishesMigrations` trait

This trait has been eliminated.

This `publishesMigration` method has a signature collision on Laravel 11.x. If you plan to import it to a multi-version Laravel package, consider using your own publishing logic.

## Laravel Octane compatibility

- There are no singletons using a stale application instance.
- There are no singletons using a stale config instance.
- There are no singletons using a stale request instance.
- `ExtendsBuilder` only initializes its static property once per Scope.

There should be no problems using this package with Laravel Octane.
